# Henry's Hacktoberfest Blog

So, in the spirit of opensource, I'm going to be writing blog posts about what I'm going to be working on in October to both [my personal blog](https://henryneeds.coffee/blog) and [DEV.to](https://dev.to/quinncuatro), but thought it would be good to include it in IO's Hacktoberfest repo, too.

This month will be spent working on the markdown editor I wish existed. Plenty are close but none are perfect. Time to change that.
